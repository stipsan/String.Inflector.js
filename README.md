Extends the String native with inflector methods, like pluralize and singularize.

Notice

This script were originally written in MooTools 1.11; so it's not 100%, but it'll get there :)

How to Use
----------

String.Slugify extends the native String object, so it works on any ordinary string.

	#JS
	"slugify  ME    n%Ã¸#w".slugify()

Returns "slugify-me-now"
